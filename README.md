# CodeClause_Flight_Delay_Prediction_Model
Flight delay prediction is a project aimed at developing a model to predict the likelihood of a flight being delayed. The project involves collecting historical flight data such as departure and arrival times, airline information, and other relevant factors that can impact a flight's performance. -> The project's objective is to develop a model that can accurately predict the flight delays and provide insights into the key factors that influence flight delays. The model can be used by airlines, airport authorities, and passengers to plan their travel better and reduce impact of flight delays. -> This model is trained based on the departure time delay and arrival time delay of an airline and its other constraints due to which the flights got delayed.
